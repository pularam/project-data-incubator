32016,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,2000,China,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",,Low-interest loan from Chinese bank to finance plywood factory in Cambodia (Linked to Project ID#32071),"On July 26, 2000, Keat Chhon, state minister and minister of economy and finance, and Yang Zilin, president of the Chinese Export-Import Bank signed an agreement under which the China Export-Import Bank agreed to provide the Cambodian government with a low-interest loan of 99.6 million CNY or about US$11.85m dollars to build a plywood factory. The loan with an annual 3 per cent interest rate is to be repaid in 12 years, including a four-year grace period. The Cambodian government would lend this money to a Chinese-Cambodian joint venture, Kampuchea-Chinese International Cooperation Co Ltd, which is behind the project to build a factory producing plywood from rubber trees and scraps in Chup and Memot plantations, Kompong Cham Province (See Project ID#32071 for the follow-up of this agreement) STAFF_NOTE: Unsure regarding the kind of product that will be produced by the factory. While the Cambodian newspaper `Reaksmei Kampuchea' reported that the factory will produce plywood , Xinhua News Agency reported that the factory will produce Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) (recorded in Project ID#32071). Although both plywood and MDF are made of the same material (rubber wood), they are of different density, hence different kind of material. It may be a reporting error on the part of either one of the publisher or the factory would be producing both plywood and MDF. Despite this issue, I am confident that this project (ID#32016) and Project ID#32071 are referring to the same event. As such, the transaction amount has been temporarily removed from this project to prevent potential double-counting of Chinese financing.

The loan agreement was signed between Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Ning Fukui and the Cambodian government on November 27, 2003 in Phnom Penh. The interest-free loan agreement was one of two agreements signed during the ceremony; under the other agreement, China would provide a grant of US$6.1 million dollar to Cambodia, which would then be handed over to the Cambodian Foreign Ministry for general use by the Cambodian government (See Project ID#32081). The rebuilding project was undertaken by Shanghai Construction Group General Co. The project began on October 2004 and was completed on 31 Dec 2007. An Inauguration for the opening of the road was held on April 29, 2008. The interest-free loan is not the only recorded financial assistance provided by the Chinese government the project. In November 2002, China had provided a concessional loan with a 2% interest rate of US$60,980,000. On the same date, China had also provided US$2,430,000 in grant for the project (based on the 2 CDC reports found in the resource section below). The CDC reports are supported by a speech made by Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, during his visit to the construction sites of National Road 7 in 26 July 2006; the PM has mentioned three types of assistance by China for the project- grant, non-interest loan and low-interest loan. It is difficult to tell if the US$24 million interest-free loan was provided by the Chinese government in addition to the US$60.98 million loan and US$2.43 million grant, or if the Chinese government has converted US$24 million out of the US$60.98 concessional loan into an interest-free loan. However, the 2009 'Overview on Transport Infrastructure Sectors in the Kingdom of Cambodia' report published by the Infrastructure and Regional Integration Technical Working Group (IRITWG) has recorded that the total cost of the rehabilitation project for National Road 7 is around US$62.8 million dollars and was financed by China, so the latter scenario is more likely. STAFF_NOTE: A document from the Cambodian Ministry of Transport stated in 2015 that the money for the renovations of road 7 was not separate from the money used to construct national roads 71 and 72. The document cited $112 million USD as the total transaction amount, but did not break the costs down further about how much went to road 7 specifically. It is also unclear whether the money mentioned in the 2015 document is for a newer round of renovations on National Road no. 7 than the ones described in this project.",Completion,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),ODA-like,Development,210,Transport and Storage,"https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020031127dzbr001bj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020031127dzbr000jj&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://data.opendevelopmentmekong.net/dataset/8b056306-0cd1-4b71-8361-65da79adcfd0/resource/37398c0b-74cc-4bb8-a7cb-cc0491059706/download/IRITWGOverviewoftheTransportInfrastructureSectorintheKingdomofCambodia2015.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cnv.org.kh/selected-comments-in-the-visit-to-the-construction-sites-of-national-road-7-and-se-kong-bridge-in-the-province-of-stoeung-treng/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM881&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM872&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.academia.edu/6898359/Cambodia-China_Relations_Based_on_the_Mutually_Beneficial_Interests_China_the_Most_Trusted_Friend_beyond_Doubt, Academic Journal Article; http://www.cdri.org.kh/webdata/download/wp/wp52e.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); http://kh.china-embassy.org/chn/zgjx/t450610.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.shsz.org.cn/book/shownews.asp?num=szzz-2006929154356, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://data.opendevelopmentmekong.net/dataset/8b056306-0cd1-4b71-8361-65da79adcfd0/resource/37398c0b-74cc-4bb8-a7cb-cc0491059706/download/IRITWGOverviewoftheTransportInfrastructureSectorintheKingdomofCambodia2015.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://data.opendevelopmentmekong.net/dataset/8b056306-0cd1-4b71-8361-65da79adcfd0/resource/37398c0b-74cc-4bb8-a7cb-cc0491059706/download/IRITWGOverviewoftheTransportInfrastructureSectorintheKingdomofCambodia2015.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",12,"China, Government Agency",1,,0,24000000,USD,0.453865945,1,52879050.04,24000000,10/1/2004,,12/31/2007,,Cambodia,811,728,Cambodia,KHM,KH,116,522,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Interest-Free,0,,,,Stung Treng; Kratie,"Hun Sen, Cambodian Prime Minister (Cambodia)",TRUE,FALSE

On Poan Monirath and the Chairman of EXIM Bank of China, Mr Li Ruogu, signed a Preferential Buyer's Credit Loan Agreement. Under the agreement, EXIM bank agrees to provide a concessional loan of US$31,014,469 for an irrigation project in Kampong Trabek, Prey Veng Province. The loan agreement for the project is one out of 14 agreements signed between China and Cambodia on 21 December 2009; the total value of the agreements was widely believed to be US$853 million (See Project ID#32201). While the development of an irrigation system is one of the objective, the project is more known to be a flood control project in response to Kampong Trabek being susceptible to flood damage. Based on a report by Mekong River Commission (MRC), the flood risk has been estimated at US$0.7 million per year. The goal of the project is to improve flood control standard and to upgrade land utilization rate, cultivation condition and grain output and to build flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Tra Beak river together with field irrigation and drainage system so as to provide irrigation water source and ensure drainage capability. Based on the CDC report, the project will include the building of flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Trabek river (aka Kampong Trabek River or Stung Trabek) together with an irrigation canal and drainage canal network so as to provide irrigation water source for crops and ensure drainage capability to prevent flood damage. This corroborates with the MRC report, which has mentioned similar flood control mechanism with much more details and has reported that once the proposed flood control mechanism have been installed, the villagers can expect about 5 crops per year and net benefits from paddy of US$3.45 million/year According to Mekong Institute, the project was completed on March 24, 2014. The project was handed over to Cambodia in April 2015. The loan details are unknown.

Indonesia plans to use the loan for infrastructure projects including the building of a power plant in Sumatra by the state-owned power company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (project #34922) and a railway track construction project in Java by the state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia. In May 2004 Indonesia used US$70 million of the loan to continue construction of a 160 kilometer double track linking Cirebon in West Java to Kroya in Central Java. It also appears that Indonesia used US$160 million of the loan for the construction of Suramadu bridge (project #34757). China would subsequently add an additional loan of US$200 million for the Parit Baru power plant (#35240) and double-track railway in Java (#38862). Staff Note: Conflicting accounts on loan amount.

The goal of the project is to improve the lives and agriculture production of Cambodian farmers. The project can be linked back to late 2008, in which the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology has begun preliminary studies for the building of a series of dams across four provinces. The dams are aimed to provide the country with a more modern irrigation system as well as generate electricity for rural communities. In September 2008, it was reported that the ministry has aimed to build four dams in Pursat province that would supply irrigation to more than 35,000 hectares of land and generate as much as 300 megawatts of power for local communities. STAFF_NOTE: There are a number of dams in the province of Pursat that are in the pipeline and financed by the Chinese government, thus I am unsure which 'Stung Pursat Dam' that the Council for the Development of Cambodia(CDC) report is referring to. There are 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam', 'Stung Pursat I', 'Stung Pursat II', 'Stung Pursat Dam No.3' and 'Stung Pursat Dam No.5'. Based on several reports, I believe that this report is referring to 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam'. Based on the 'International Rivers' report, the expected completion year for the dam is 2015, which is similar to the completion date reported in the CDC Summary Report. Both reports has also stated that the dam is still under construction. Based on a report by Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI) and published by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) in 2011, both 'Stung Pursat I' and 'Stung Pursat II' are still under MOU study, thus the CDC report cannot be referring to this two projects as the the Pursat dam project in the CDC report had already been approved in 13 December 2010. There is also a very high probability that the CDC report is not referring to the 'Stung Pursat Dam No.3' and 'Stung Pursat Dam No.5' because both projects are estimated to cost US$60 million dollars and only be implemented in 2014 (based on the 2011 ADB report), while the CDC report mentioned a US$63 134 700 loan for a single dam, and is implemented before 2014. Thus further details found in this description will be referring to the 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam'. MORE RESEARCH will be needed to confidently pinpoint which dam project in the province of Pursat the CDC report is referring to. The Stung Atay Pursat Dam is a 120 (MW) Hydropower dam along the Atay River. its expected total project cost is US$225 million dollars and the construction is undertaken by Cambodia Hydropower Development Co Ltd (subsidary of China Datang Overseas Investment Co., Ltd.).

Concessional loans was received by Cambodia in two separate events: On July 2005, Cambodia Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen signed five agreements guaranteeing funds during the second summit of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Under the agreements, China agreed to provide concessional loan of US$30 million to the Cambodian government to build a new Council of Ministers building. In 2007, Prime Minister Hun Sen witnessed the signing of a '50 million yuan (about US$7 million) with low-interest loan for the additional construction of the Council of Ministers Office' during his participation in the Fourth China-ASEAN International Exhibition.

The building has been used since February 2009, but it has not been officially inaugurated until 19 October 2010. While the construction of the building was initially reported to be funded by China's concessional loan, it was reported later that China has donated the office building as part of China's gift from the Chinese government to honour 50 years of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Phnom Penh (reported in article published by Xinhua News Agency, 12 August 2008).

The financing amount is 455 million USD. The loan has 13 years of maturity, which includes 3 years of grace period. The $808.4 million power plant in Lontar, Banten (known as Banten 3 or Banten Lontar), has a capacity of 945 MW (3 x 315 MW) and was built by a consortium that included Chinese power equipment giant Dongfang Electric Corp. and Indonesian Dalle Energy. 28 December 2012 marked the handing over ceremony of the structures and operations of power generators that has been completed, from China to Indonesia. The plant is currently still in operation. The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in JENEPONTO (SOUTH SULAWESI) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia. There has been little information on all the projects that have been cancelled or successfully funded after the suspensions in funding. However, some information on several projects is available and have individual project records with updated information.

The Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati witnessed the signing of the agreement. The plant is 2x110 MW units, which should start up in early 2011. The loan has a 15-year maturity, with a three-year grace period. In August 2014, the 2x110MW power plants were completed and commercially operational. The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in Jeneponto (South Sulawesi) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia.

The plant is built on a 83-hectare site in Sumur Adem village in Indramayu, West Java and is one of the power plants in the first phase of the government's 10,000 MW fast-track program. The construction of the Indramayu plant began in 2007, and was contracted to a consortium consisting of the China National Machinery Industry Corporation, the China National Electric Equipment Corporation and PT Penta Adi Samudera as the contractor. The total investment required to set up the power plant reached US$696.73 million plus Rp 1.5 trillion. Of this, the US$592 million syndicated loan was arranged by a Bank of China-led consortium of banks for PLN Persero in May 2008. The deal carries a tenor of 13 years, with a three-year period of grace. Along with China Export-Import Bank, BNP Paribas, China Construction Bank, China Development Bank, ICBC, Société Générale and China Citic joined the list of mandated lead arrangers. Nine banks joined the senior lead arranger group: ANZ Bank, Bayerische Landesbank, Calyon, Credit Suisse, Fortis, ING, Natixis, RBS and WestLB. Lead arrangers were Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). Sinosure (China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation) is insuring 95% of the loan, and the Indonesian ministry of finance is providing a full guarantee. Despite the fact that the facility was heavily oversubscribed, Indonesia chose to take only US$592 million, which is 85% of the total contract price. The remaining 15% of the total cost will be provided in local currency financing arrangements by Indonesian banks. The 1st and 2nd unit of the 3x330MW power plant started commercial operations in January and May 2011 respectively, while the 3rd unit passed the performance testing in September 2011.
